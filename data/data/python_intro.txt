Python Programming Language

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Python is widely used in:
- Web development
- Data science and machine learning
- Automation and scripting

One of Python’s biggest strengths is its easy-to-understand syntax, which allows developers to write
clear and concise code. This makes Python an excellent choice for beginners as well as professionals.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional
programming. It also has a large standard library and a strong community, which helps developers build
applications faster and more efficiently.
